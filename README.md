1. Introduction
The Stock Market GUI Tracker is a desktop application built using Tkinter (a Python GUI library) to track real-time stock prices of Indian companies. The application retrieves stock data from the yfinance API, displaying the price of stocks in Indian Rupees (₹). Users can easily track live stock prices by entering the stock symbol and receiving real-time updates.

This application is designed for Indian stock markets (BSE, NSE) and displays data in ₹ (Indian Rupees).

2. Features
Real-time Updates: The application fetches live stock prices every 2 seconds.

User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive GUI for users to input stock symbols and get real-time price data.

Indian Stocks Only: Displays stock prices for Indian companies, formatted in ₹.

Error Handling: The app gracefully handles invalid stock symbols and displays a relevant message.

3. Tech Stack
Python: The core programming language used for the application.

Tkinter: The GUI library used to create the graphical interface.

yfinance: A library that pulls real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance. It supports Indian stocks with the .NS suffix (e.g., TCS.NS, RELIANCE.NS).

7. Troubleshooting
Problem: "Invalid Symbol" is displayed
Solution: Make sure you enter the correct stock symbol with the .NS suffix for Indian stocks. For example, enter TCS.NS for Tata Consultancy Services, not just TCS.

Problem: No stock data is displayed
Solution: Ensure you have an active internet connection, as the application fetches real-time stock data from the web.

Problem: Tkinter not installed
Solution: If Tkinter is not already installed, you can install it by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tk
